The terms &ldquo;</span><span class="c1">you</span><span class="c2">&rdquo; and &ldquo;</span><span class="c1">users</span><span class="c2">&rdquo; encompass all users, including both Administrative Users and Members. This document describes both your rights and your obligations as part of using the Service. It is important that you read it carefully because you will be legally bound to these terms. Bevy Community App LLC. (&ldquo;</span><span class="c1">Bevy</span><span class="c2">&rdquo; &ldquo;</span><span class="c1">we</span><span class="c2">&rdquo; &ldquo;</span><span class="c1">us</span><span class="c2">&rdquo;) only provides its Service (as defined below) to you subject to this TOS. By accepting this TOS or by accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by this TOS (including the Privacy Policy, which is incorporated here by reference).</span></li><li class="c6"><span class="c2">&nbsp;If you are entering into this TOS on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity, its Members, its Administrative Users, and its affiliates to this TOS. In that case, the terms &ldquo;you&rdquo; or &ldquo;your&rdquo; shall also refer to such entity, its Members, its Administrative Users, and its affiliates, as applicable. If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with this TOS, you may not use the Service. You acknowledge that this TOS is a contract between you and Bevy, even though it is electronic and is not physically signed by you and Bevy, and it governs your use of the Service.</span></li><li class="c6"><span class="c2">&nbsp;As our business evolves, Bevy may change this TOS. If we make a material change to the TOS, we will provide you with reasonable notice prior to the changes either by emailing the email address associated with your account or by posting a notice on the Site. You can review the most current version of the TOS at any time by visiting this page. The revised terms and conditions will become effective on the date set forth in our notice, and if you use the Service after that date, your use will constitute acceptance of the revised terms and conditions. If any change to this TOS is not acceptable to you, your only remedy is to cancel your account and stop using the Services, which you may do &nbsp;through the process provided in the Service.</span></li><li class="c6"><span class="c2">&nbsp;As part of the registration process, you will identify an Owner&rsquo;s user name (in the form of an email address) and password for your account. You may use these credentials to invite individuals to become Administrative Users and Members (each with their own password) under your account. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login, password, and account and for all activities that occur under your login or account, including the activities of Members.</span></li><li class="c6"><span class="c2">&nbsp;By accessing or using the Services, you affirm that you are at least 18 years of age (or have reached the age of majority if that is not 18 years of age where you live). You represent that you are fully able and competent to enter into and comply with the terms and conditions in this TOS. The Service is not directed to children under 13, so if you are under 13 years of age, you are not permitted to access or use the Services. If we become aware that you are using the Service even though you are under 13, we will deactivate your account.</span></li><li class="c6"><span class="c2">&nbsp;If you are a school or teacher in the United States and want your students, who are over 13, to use the Service, including in conjunction with the establishment of a Service account for the school or a group of students at the school, you are responsible for complying with the U.S. Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (&ldquo;</span><span class="c1">FERPA</span><span class="c2">&rdquo;). This means you must notify those students&rsquo; parents/guardians of the personally identifiable information you will collect and share with Bevy and obtain parental/guardian consent before your students establish accounts or use the Service. When obtaining such consent, you should provide parents/guardians with a copy of our Privacy Policy. You must keep all consents on file and provide them to us if we request them. If you are located outside of the United States, we will rely upon you to obtain any required consent or approval from the parent or guardian of any student covered by similar laws and, as a condition to your and your students&rsquo; use of the Service, you will comply with such laws.</span></li></ol><ol class="c0 lst-kix_ronoslc1zzui-0" start="2"><li class="c9 c11"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Description of Service.</span></li><li class="c9 c11"><span class="c2">The &ldquo;</span><span class="c1">Service(s)</span><span class="c2">&rdquo; means (a) Bevy&rsquo;s communication, archiving and search services and related systems and technologies, as well as the website </span><span class="c13"><a class="c5" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://joinbevy.com/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1459487905990000&amp;usg=AFQjCNExmHIbg2jBWcdA_jbMl9UGnGNm6Q">http://joinbevy.com (the &ldquo;Site&rdquo;)</a></span><span class="c2">, and (b) all software (including the Software, as defined below), applications, data, reports, text, images, and other content made available by or on behalf of Bevy through any of the foregoing.

Any modifications and new features added to the Service are also subject to this TOS.

Your acceptance of this TOS gives us the permission to do so and grants us any such rights necessary to provide the service to you, only for the purpose of providing the service (and for no other purpose).
